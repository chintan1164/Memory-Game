# Memory-Game
This Java code represents a simple memory-matching card game known as "Memory Game." The game consists of a 4x4 grid of cards, initially hidden (represented by underscores) and randomly arranged. Each card has a letter on its back, and the objective of the game is to find pairs of matching cards by flipping them over two at a time.
